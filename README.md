```

4. **Open your browser**
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
- Upload an audio file or use the provided test samples

## 📱 Usage Guide

### 1. Audio Upload
- **Supported formats**: WAV, MP3, FLAC
- **Recommended duration**: 30 seconds to 10 minutes
- **Quality guidelines**: Clear recording without background noise
- **Sample rate**: 16kHz or higher

### 2. Analysis Process
1. Upload your breathing audio file
2. Wait for automatic processing (typically <30 seconds)
3. Review the AHI score and risk assessment
4. Read personalized suggestions
5. Examine detailed visualizations

### 3. Understanding Results

#### AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) Scoring:
- 🟢 **Normal**: AHI < 5 events/hour
- 🟡 **Mild**: AHI 5-15 events/hour
- 🟠 **Moderate**: AHI 15-30 events/hour
- 🚨 **Severe**: AHI > 30 events/hour
- 🆘 **Critical**: Immediate medical attention needed

#### Risk Factors:
- **Breathing Rate**: Normal range 12-20 breaths/min
- **Pause Duration**: >3 seconds indicates apnea
- **Amplitude Variation**: Low variation suggests shallow breathing
- **Pattern Regularity**: Irregular patterns may indicate disorders

## 🧪 Test Audio Files

The project includes synthetic test audio files to demonstrate functionality:

| File | Description | Expected Result |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `test_audio/normal_breathing.wav` | Healthy breathing pattern (18 breaths/min) | 🟢 Normal (AHI < 5) |
| `test_audio/apnea_breathing.wav` | Contains 3-8 second breathing pauses | 🚨 Severe (Multiple apnea events) |
| `test_audio/mixed_breathing.wav` | Mild irregularities and short pauses | 🟡 Mild (Some abnormalities) |

### Enhanced Detection Algorithm
```python
# Multi-factor apnea scoring
apnea_score = 0.0

# Factor 1: RMS Energy (breathing intensity)
if rms_energy < 0.005:
    apnea_score += 0.5  # Critical

# Factor 2: Breathing Rate
if breathing_rate < 6:
    apnea_score += 0.5  # Severe bradypnea

# Factor 3: Pause Duration
if max_pause_duration > 10:
    apnea_score += 0.7  # Critical pause

# Factor 4: Pattern Regularity
if breath_regularity < 0.3:
    apnea_score += 0.25  # Irregular

# Final Classification
is_apnea = apnea_score > 0.35
```
